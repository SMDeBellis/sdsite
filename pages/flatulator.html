            <p>The Flatulator is my first android project. The story of the Flatulator begins in the jewelry department of the department store I used to work in selling electronics. I have always been an electronics enthusiast and have always had to have the newest gadgets. I became a big fan of the android phones and the android platform. I had been going to school for a couple of years studying computer science. One afternoon I was talking to Steven, one of the Jewelry salesmen about school. He asked me what I was interested and what I wanted to do. I told him that I really wanted to create cellphone applications. He asked what kind of app I wanted to make. I really hadn't thought of any ideas so jokingly I told him that I was going to make an application that makes fart noises. We both had a good laugh and then we went back to work. A few months later after the term ended and I had some free time to work on my own projects. I installed the android SDK and then watched a few basic tutorials on android application development. After a little research I had learned the basics of android applications. My mind went back to my conversation with Steven and I thought to myself, why not. It would be a good project to figure out how to work with buttons and sounds. I found some mp3 files that were on the internet and then went to work. The first version of the app had just the standard default buttons. After I got all of the buttons working I did the graphical design of both of the screens and the custom buttons. And That is the story of how the Flatulator came to life.</p>
